Important Submission Requirements
------------------------------
1. **No Late Days**

   - Late days cannot be used for any portion of the final project
   - Failure to submit any section on time results in a 0 for that component
   - Office hours will be available as usual to help you meet deadlines

2. **Project Proposal (Due 5/20)**
   
   - ~One page, single-spaced document containing:
  
     - Goal: Clear description of what you aim to achieve with your project
     - Motivation: Why this project is interesting/important and how it builds on course material
     - Technical Plan: 
  
       - Detailed breakdown of required components and implementation approach
       - List of needed hardware/software resources (which we can reimburse for)
       - Identification of key technical challenges and proposed solutions
  
     - Schedule:
  
       - Week-by-week timeline of milestones and deliverables
       - Specific goals to hit by progress report deadline (5/30)
       - Backup plans for each major component if original approach fails
       - Risk assessment of which parts may take longer than expected
  
   - TAs will provide a link to schedule your mandatory meeting after grading your proposal
   - We will grade your proposals and schedule meetings as soon as possible to help you get started on your project

3. **Progress Report (Due 5/30)**

   - ~One page, single-spaced
   - Must be completely different from your proposal
   - Must include a video showing some implemented and functional features
   - **Important**: If you're too busy to compile a detailed progress report, you can just submit your in-progress project log + demo video instead
   - Failure to show functional implementation in the video, or copy/pasting from the project proposal will result in significant penalties

Project Ideas
-----------
We've compiled a list of potential project ideas to help you get started. You can find them in our `Project Ideas Spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMy-Vo0vjHK6ASFYn5OJlKVUja1LdaAGdy50HYk_MDw/edit?usp=sharing>`_. The spreadsheet includes suggested starting points from various labs (including the optional labs), which you can extend in creative ways. Feel free to use these as inspiration or come up with your own ideas!

Project Advice
------------
1. **Think Big, Plan Carefully**
   
   - Aim for an ambitious project that excites you
   - Break down your project into manageable milestones
   - Have a clear backup plan if your primary idea proves too challenging

2. **Time Management**
   
   - Three weeks is not a lot of time, and time flies!
   - Set clear weekly goals and stick to them
   - Leave buffer time for debugging and refinement

3. **Documentation**
   
   - Keep track of your progress
   - Document challenges and solutions
   - Take videos of your work-in-progress

4. **Testing**
   
   - Test early and often
   - Start with simple functionality and build up
   - Don't wait until the last minute to test your complete system

5. **Presentation**
   
   - Plan your demo carefully
   - Have a backup plan in case of technical issues
   - Practice your presentation

Remember: The best projects are those that are both ambitious and achievable. Choose something that challenges you but can be completed within the time constraints. Good luck!
